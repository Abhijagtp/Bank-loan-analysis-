# Bank-loan-analysis-
In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of a bank loan application dataset to derive valuable insights and enhance the accuracy of subsequent modeling. The project comprises several key tasks that focus on data cleaning, outlier detection, addressing data imbalance, and conducting various analyses to understand the factors influencing loan default.
Key Learnings from the Bank Loan Analysis Project:

- Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing data effectively using Excel functions like COUNT, ISBLANK, and IF.
Use appropriate methods, such as imputation using AVERAGE or MEDIAN, to address missing values.

- Outlier Detection:
Utilize Excel statistical functions (QUARTILE, IQR) and conditional formatting to identify outliers in numerical variables.
Apply thresholds or business rules to determine the validity of outliers, ensuring data integrity.

- Data Imbalance Analysis:
Calculate class proportions using Excel functions like COUNTIF and SUM to assess data imbalance.  Visualize the distribution of the target variable with pie charts or bar charts, highlighting any imbalance.

- Descriptive Analysis:
Perform univariate analysis using Excel functions such as COUNT, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and statistical functions to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Utilize Excel features like filters, sorting, and pivot tables for segmented and bivariate analysis.

- Visualization Techniques:
Create various visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, box plots, stacked bar charts, and scatter plots, to represent variable distributions and relationships.

- Correlation Analysis:
Segment the dataset based on scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties) to perform targeted correlation analysis.
Use Excel functions like CORREL to calculate correlation coefficients and visualize them through correlation matrices or heatmaps.

- Identifying Loan Default Drivers:
Identify top correlations within different scenarios, providing insights into potential indicators of loan default.
Correlate variables with the target variable to understand the relationships contributing to loan default.

-Enhanced Data Understanding:
Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's quality, distribution, and potential influencing factors on loan default.

- Preparation for Modeling:
Create a clean dataset with addressed missing values and outliers, setting the stage for robust predictive modeling.

- Business Insights:
Derive actionable insights for stakeholders by understanding key drivers and patterns related to loan default.
