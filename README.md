# Bank-loan-analysis-
In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of a bank loan application dataset to derive valuable insights and enhance the accuracy of subsequent modeling. The project comprises several key tasks that focus on data cleaning, outlier detection, addressing data imbalance, and conducting various analyses to understand the factors influencing loan default.

Analyzed dataset is provided in pdf/ppt: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eLpuyMrA7JUaLkXFoUqcHCIUeSb915Qa/view?usp=drive_link

Key Learnings from the Bank Loan Analysis Project:
- Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing data effectively using Excel functions like COUNT, ISBLANK, and IF.
Use appropriate methods, such as imputation using AVERAGE or MEDIAN, to address missing values.

- Outlier Detection:
Utilize Excel statistical functions (QUARTILE, IQR) and conditional formatting to identify outliers in numerical variables.
Apply thresholds or business rules to determine the validity of outliers, ensuring data integrity.

- Data Imbalance Analysis:
Calculate class proportions using Excel functions like COUNTIF and SUM to assess data imbalance.  Visualize the distribution of the target variable with pie charts or bar charts, highlighting any imbalance.

- Descriptive Analysis:
Perform univariate analysis using Excel functions such as COUNT, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and statistical functions to understand the distribution of individual variables.
Utilize Excel features like filters, sorting, and pivot tables for segmented and bivariate analysis.

- Visualization Techniques:
Create various visualizations, including histograms, bar charts, box plots, stacked bar charts, and scatter plots, to represent variable distributions and relationships.

- Correlation Analysis:
Segment the dataset based on scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties) to perform targeted correlation analysis.
Use Excel functions like CORREL to calculate correlation coefficients and visualize them through correlation matrices or heatmaps.

- Identifying Loan Default Drivers:
Identify top correlations within different scenarios, providing insights into potential indicators of loan default.
Correlate variables with the target variable to understand the relationships contributing to loan default.

- Enhanced Data Understanding:
Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's quality, distribution, and potential influencing factors on loan default.

- Preparation for Modeling:
Create a clean dataset with addressed missing values and outliers, setting the stage for robust predictive modeling.

- Business Insights:
Derive actionable insights for stakeholders by understanding key drivers and patterns related to loan default.


QUESTIONS/TASKS

A. Identify Missing Data and Deal with it Appropriately: As a data analyst, you come across missing data in the loan application dataset. It is essential to handle missing data effectively to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
Task: Identify the missing data in the dataset and decide on an appropriate method to deal with it using Excel built-in functions and features.

B. Identify Outliers in the Dataset: Outliers can significantly impact the analysis and distort the results. You need to identify outliers in the loan application dataset.
Task: Detect and identify outliers in the dataset using Excel statistical functions and features, focusing on numerical variables.

C. Analyze Data Imbalance: Data imbalance can affect the accuracy of the analysis, especially for binary classification problems. Understanding the data distribution is crucial for building reliable models.
Task: Determine if there is data imbalance in the loan application dataset and calculate the ratio of data imbalance using Excel functions.

D. Perform Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: To gain insights into the driving factors of loan default, it is important to conduct various analyses on consumer and loan attributes.
Task: Perform univariate analysis to understand the distribution of individual variables, segmented univariate analysis to compare variable distributions for different scenarios, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables and the target variable using Excel functions and features.

E. Identify Top Correlations for Different Scenarios: Understanding the correlation between variables and the target variable can provide insights into strong indicators of loan default.
Task: Segment the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., clients with payment difficulties and all other cases) and identify the top correlations for each segmented data using Excel functions.
